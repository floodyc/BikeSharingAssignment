## General Information
- This is a project performing Multiple Linear Regression on a dataset.
- This project will be submitted to the ML & AI Course on Data Science.
- This project is attempting to solve the problem of predicting bike rental based on 
  factors such as weather and temperature as well as whether it is a holiday or not.
- This project is using a data set of bike rentals from a US company called Boombikes.


## Conclusions
- Bike demand is heavily dependant on season, with spring showing greatest demand followed by winter and then summer.
- The mean squared error is almost zero for both the training and testing data.
- The R-squared value of the test set is 74.2% and the value for the train set is 77.9%. There is good alignment between these two values so     we can say that the variance was predicted well on the test set so this can be said to be a good model.
- The business efforts around more bike sales should include focusing on the spring season, the winter months and when the weather is not       best.
